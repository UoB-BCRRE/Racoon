# Upper directory

Rail Ontology 'Upper' module. Upper level concepts common cross-domain, not rail-specific vocab.

* 3d.ttl is the entire core ontology from a 3D perspective
* 4d.ttl is the entire core ontology from a 4D perspective (import this for a 4D application)
* cv.ttl contains all constraints for the upper ontology. In a seperate file so that the choice can be made to treat it as 'closed world' (in Pellet CV)
* doc.ttl is a documentation ontology used across the project.
* tbox.ttl is the 3D/4D agnostic upper ontology
